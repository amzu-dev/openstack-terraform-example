# Openstack Terraform Example

## Architecture Digram


![Example Architecture](architecture.png?raw=true "Example Architecture for Openstack with Terraform")


## Description

> Note that I have not tested this with OpenStack as I don't have access to one (can try using Packstack but requires some time to install it in my mac)

I wrote this to give a demo of how to use terraform with Openstack. 
This script will create 1 load balancer with port 80 and 8080 available to be accessed along with a min 3 nodes.

    > terraform init
    > terraform plan
    > terraform apply
